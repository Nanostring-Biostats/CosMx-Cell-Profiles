No rights are granted to NanoString Competitors.

If you institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Data, Modified Data, or a modification incorporated within the Data or a Modified Data constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to you under this License for the Data or any such Modified Data shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

THE LICENSOR DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE DATA WILL BE ERROR FREE AND DOES NOT PROMISE THAT ANY SUCH ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW FOR THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE FOREGOING MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
4.2.	Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR OR NANOSTRING BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE DATA OR USE THEREOF, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR NANOSTRING HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES.

5.	MISCELLANEOUS
5.1.	Right to Enforce. NanoString is an express third-party beneficiary of this License and will be entitled to enforce the provisions of this License as if it were a party hereto.

The waiver by Licensor of, or consent by Licensor to, a breach of any provision of this License by the Licensee, will not constitute, operate or be construed as a waiver of, consent to, or excuse of any other or subsequent breach by Licensee.  This License may be amended or modified only by an agreement in writing signed by an authorized representative of each of Licensor and Licensee.
